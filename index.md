# Comparing Sea Surface Temperature Anomalies from JAMSTEC ARGO Float Data to NOAA ERSST V5 SST anomalies for Nino 1+2, Nino 3, Nino 4, and Nino 3.4. 

## by: Jaedyn Williams

## Introduction:
The first set of data is analyzed Argo data from JAMSTEC (Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology). The temperature and salinity profiles are obtained from Argo floats. The Argo floats drift with the ocean currents. The floats descend to 2,000 meters every 10 days and collect a vertical profile of temperature and salinity. The index that was used to compare with the JAMSTEC data was the NOAA ERSST V5 SST anomalies for Nino 1+2, Nino 3, Nino 4, and Nino 3.4. The Nino 1+2 is the SST data for the Extreme Eastern Tropical Pacific. Nino 3 is the SST for the Eastern Tropical Pacific. Nino 4 is the SST for the Central Tropical Pacific. Nino 3.4 is the SST for the East Central Tropical Pacific. The initial questions that I had before doing this project were the following: Will increases in SST lower salinity? Where are SST and SSS anomalies the most present? Are there more negative or positive correlations between SST and SSS? How are the correlations different or similar between an El Nino and La Nina year? What patterns are consistent over the 23 years of data?

## Summary:
One of the greatest challenges for working with the data that I selected was being able to work with a large set of data. The data from JAMSTEC was separated by year and month so there were over 276 files of data that I was working with.
